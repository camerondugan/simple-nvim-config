# My Incredibly Simple Nvim Config

## Goals:
1. Editing without being slowed down
1. Small size for simplicity in configuration
1. Easily adaptable by others

## Setup:

This will move your current config to ~/.config/nvim.bak and will then install this config in its place

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
git clone https://github.com/camerondugan/simple-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
